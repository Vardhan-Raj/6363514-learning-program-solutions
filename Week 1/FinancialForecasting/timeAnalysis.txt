Time Complexity : 
        What's my Approach	    Time Complexity	Space Complexity
        ForecastRecursive	         O(n)	        O(n) (stack calls)
        ForecastRecursiveMemo	     O(n)	        O(n) (dict + stack)
        ForecastIterative	         O(n)	        O(1)

(i) Plain recursion repeats computations unnecessarily â€” avoid for large n.
(ii) Memoization stores already computed results to avoid re-calculation.
(iii) Iterative is the most space-efficient and best for production code.
