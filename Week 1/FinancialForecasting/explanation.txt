Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
It is useful when:
    (i) The problem is defined in terms of smaller subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci, factorial)
    (ii) You want clean, readable code (but must control stack depth and redundancy)

In financial forecasting, recursion can simulate year-on-year growth based on a given rate.
